🎨 Color Composition Optimizer
Predictive Modeling for Dye Manufacturing Using XGBoost & Scikit-learn

📌 Project Overview
In industrial dye manufacturing, precisely achieving target LAB color values is crucial to product consistency. This project develops a machine learning model to predict optimal dye compositions that achieve desired LAB color specifications. By learning from historical formulations, the model provides accurate and scalable recommendations to optimize dye mixing processes.

🚀 Key Features
🎯 LAB Color Space Prediction: Predicts the resulting LAB values from given pigment compositions.

🧠 XGBoost Regression: Utilizes a robust ensemble model for high-accuracy multi-output regression.

⚙️ Scikit-learn Pipeline: Streamlined data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling.

📊 Interactive Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize trends and correlations.

📁 Notebook-driven Workflow: End-to-end implementation in a Jupyter Notebook for reproducibility.
